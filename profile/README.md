**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->
### TLDR
Check out [browningluke-iac/docs](https://github.com/browningluke-iac/docs) (very much a WIP) for detailed 
information about what is deployed, how it was deployed, and anything else noteworthy.

Check out [browningluke-org/homelab](https://github.com/browningluke-org/homelab), the soon-to-be-archived
monorepo that was the precursor of this organization.

### A Brief History
This infrastructure started as a homelab in 2019, with an old laptop and a Ubuntu distro. Since then, it has grown 
and evolved through many different iterations of hardware and software, until it reached the point it is at now. 
I hesitate to call it a 'homelab' anymore, since the scope of the project has grown to exceed my _home_, but the 
spirit of the project is still one of tinkering, breaking things, and improving. This is a passion project that has
grown to be something I am proud of. Many a sleepless hour have been spent improving and redoing.

An initial attempt at codifying was made in [browningluke-org/homelab](https://github.com/browningluke-org/homelab),
a monorepo precursor to this organization. That repo contains some documentation, albeit very limited, as well as a
complete rewrite attempt - before abandoning the monorepo philosophy. Since then, all meaningful units have been split
into their own repos.

### The Purpose
This organization is the hub for all infrastucture repos, as well as a couple of configuration repos, for the 
browningluke.dev zone. There is a hope that it will serve as an inspiration and reference to whomever is thinking
of starting, and growing, their own homelab. Any and all explorations and pitfalls will be left in
the git history with hope they act as guidance and warnings for those such people.
